Coordination integrity — atomic park, rate-limit rollback, defer-resume cycle cap, ledger race fix. Resolves #35, #36, #37, #38 (partial), #41, top-priority E + I.

The framework's coordination primitives had three gaps. The kernel's load-bearing claim ("the same intent cannot side-effect twice") sat behind first-writer-wins on the ledger key, which two parallel `adjudicate()` callers could both pass before either recorded the SET-NX. The defer-resume cycle had no global cap on resume-park-resume oscillation. Rate-limit counters incremented on every request — including REFUSEd ones — letting hostile traffic exhaust legitimate users' budgets.

- **NEW: `RateLimitResult.rollback()`** — return a rollback handle from `checkRateLimit`. When the kernel returns a non-EXECUTE Decision, the executor invokes `rollback` to decrement the counter. Idempotent (safe to call once or skip). No-op when the store does not implement `decrement`.
- **NEW: `RateLimitStore.decrement?(key)`** — optional method on the store contract. `createInMemoryRateLimitStore` implements it (clamps to zero). Adopter Redis stores wire `DECR`.
- **NEW: `AdjudicateAndAuditDeps.rateLimitRollback?: () => Promise<void>`** — when supplied, fires after sink emission iff the Decision was non-EXECUTE. Adopters compose with `checkRateLimit().rollback`.
- **NEW: `Ledger.recordExecution` returns `Promise<"acquired" | "exists">`** (T1 carryover, surfaced here too) — `adjudicateAndAudit` uses the tag to flip a racing EXECUTE to `ledger_replay_suppressed` when SET-NX collides, closing #37 (parallel callers cannot both side-effect).
- **NEW: `DEFAULT_MAX_RESUME_CYCLES = 3`** + `ResumeDeferredIntentArgs.maxResumeCycles` — per-`intentHash` resume cycle counter prevents DEFER → resume → DEFER oscillation under a misbehaving signal source. Returns `{ resumed: false, reason: "cycle_cap_exceeded" }` past the cap. Set to `0` to disable; back-compat skip when `redis.incr` is not wired.
- **NEW: `DeferRedis.incr?` and `DeferRedis.expire?`** — optional Redis methods used by the cycle cap. Old adopters whose client lacks `incr` see no behavioural change (cap silently disabled).
- **NEW: `ParkRedis.evalIncrCheck?(counterKey, ttlSeconds, max)`** — optional atomic Lua-eval increment-and-check. When wired, `parkDeferredIntent` uses it instead of the INCR-then-check sequence, eliminating the small race window at quota − 1. Adopters whose Redis client exposes `eval` can supply this; the framework falls back to the non-atomic sequence (the existing behaviour) when omitted.
- **CHANGED: `parkDeferredIntent` EXPIRE refresh.** The pre-T5 implementation set the counter TTL via `EXPIRE NX` — once, on first park. Now the TTL refreshes on every park (no NX flag), so the counter outlives the latest envelope, not the first one's. Resolves #36.
- **NEW: `taintRank(taint)`** exported from `@adjudicate/core` — used internally by `withBasisAudit` REWRITE-taint regression check (T4 carryover).
- **NEW: 3 unit tests** (`rate-limit.test.ts`) for `RateLimitResult.rollback` (decrement, idempotency, store-without-decrement no-op).
- **NEW: 4 unit tests** (`defer-resume-cycle-cap.test.ts`) for default cap, custom cap, disabled cap, back-compat skip.

**Migration:**
- Adopters using `checkRateLimit`: `result.rollback` is additive — call it on non-EXECUTE outcomes to fix #41. Old call sites that ignore it continue to work (counter stays advanced).
- Adopters using `parkDeferredIntent`: counter TTL behaviour changes — refreshes on every park. Implementations whose Redis `expire` rejects calls without the NX flag must accept the new signature (`expire(key, seconds, mode?)` — second arg now optional).
- Adopters using `resumeDeferredIntent`: no migration needed; the cycle cap is opt-in via wiring `redis.incr`.
