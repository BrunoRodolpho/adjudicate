Distributed kill switch via polled Redis + IBX_KERNEL_ENFORCE typo guard. Resolves #15, #17, #40, top-priority C.

The kernel's `setKillSwitch` writes a module-level singleton — a single process can revoke its own authority but nothing propagates across replicas. Multi-replica deployments had no path to halt the fleet without redeploying. T7 ships an opt-in distributed primitive that keeps the kernel's `adjudicate()` strictly synchronous (no async-everywhere) by polling a Redis key into the runtime context's in-process kill-switch.

Independently, `IBX_KERNEL_ENFORCE`/`IBX_KERNEL_SHADOW` accepted any comma-separated string. A typo like `IBX_KERNEL_ENFORCE=order.confrim` silently left `order.confirm` on the legacy path — exactly the cutover hazard the staged rollout exists to prevent.

- **NEW: `startDistributedKillSwitch({ redis, key, pollMs?, context?, logger? })`** in `@adjudicate/audit` — polls a Redis key on a `pollMs` cadence (default 1000ms). When the key carries `{active: boolean, reason: string}`, the value flows into `RuntimeContext.killSwitch.set(...)`. Within `pollMs * 2` of a remote write, every replica's `adjudicate()` returns `kill_switch_active`.
- **NEW: handle methods `trip(reason)` / `clear()` / `stop()`** — convenience wrappers around `redis SET` plus a poller-stop. `stop()` is idempotent and synchronous post-call (timer cleared).
- **NEW: poll error observability** — Redis GET errors and malformed payloads emit `recordSinkFailure({ subject: "distributed-kill-switch", errorClass: "redis_get" | "redis_payload" })`, plus an optional structured `logger.warn` callback.
- **NEW: `validateEnforceConfig(knownIntents, env?, warn?)`** in `@adjudicate/core/kernel` — call once at boot. Compares every token in `IBX_KERNEL_SHADOW`/`IBX_KERNEL_ENFORCE` against the known-intent set (typically the union of every installed Pack's `intents`). Unknown tokens emit a `console.warn` plus `recordSinkFailure({ errorClass: "enforce_config_typo" })`. Returns `{ unknownShadow, unknownEnforce }` for further inspection. Wildcard `*` is honoured.
- **NEW: 8 unit tests** (`distributed-kill-switch.test.ts`) covering apply-on-poll, key-absent no-op, transition handling, trip/clear convenience, redis-error and malformed-payload observability, stop semantics, optional logger.
- **NEW: 5 unit tests** (`enforce-config.test.ts`) for `validateEnforceConfig` — clean config, shadow typos, enforce typos, wildcard, both-typos.

**Migration:** opt-in throughout. Existing single-process deployments continue to work via the module-level kill switch; multi-replica deployments call `startDistributedKillSwitch()` at boot. ENFORCE typo detection is a new boot-time check; adopters with `IBX_KERNEL_ENFORCE=*` or no env var continue without change.
